## Playlistpilot Frontend

# Introduction

This is a react app that allows you to add playlists to it and add songs for that pplay list. The front end is build with react giving the user a dynamic experience when interactng with the app

## Set up

Once cloned to your local machine the project can be run using `npm start`

On the interface one should see the different playlists already added to the app and the can click the 'View Playlist" button to see the different songs in the specific playlists

To add a new playlist one should navigate to the 'Add playlist' form and add another playlist. After putting the details and clicking the submit button one should be able to see the playlist appear on the homepage. The can then click "Add song" and a modal will appear prompting them to add a song to the playlist

## Core deliverables

1. The user is able to see the playlists on the homepage once the app loads
2. The user is able to add a new playlist to the homepage through the add playlist form
3. The user is able to add songs to the playlist using the 'add song' button
4. The user is able to view the songs in a playlist using the 'view playlist' button

## Requirements

1. Code Editor(Vscode)
2. Github account

## Extra information on react app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Trobuleshooting

If the playlists are not visible on your page you should make sure the server from the backend is up and running. The instructions o how to set up the backend are on the Playlistpilot backend repo in the README file
